/**
 * Indicates that an attribute called "transient"
 * should be declared with the given {@code value}
 * when the {@link Introspector} constructs
 * a {@link PropertyDescriptor} or {@link EventSetDescriptor}
 * classes associated with the annotated code element.
 * A {@code true} value for the "transient" attribute
 * indicates to encoders derived from {@link Encoder}
 * that this feature should be ignored.
 * <p/>
 * The {@code Transient} annotation may be be used
 * in any of the methods that are involved
 * in a {@link FeatureDescriptor} subclass
 * to identify the transient feature in the annotated class and its subclasses.
 * Normally, the method that starts with "get" is the best place
 * to put the annotation and it is this declaration
 * that takes precedence in the case of multiple annotations
 * being defined for the same feature.
 * <p/>
 * To declare a feature non-transient in a class
 * whose superclass declares it transient,
 * use {@code @Transient(false)}.
 * In all cases, the {@link Introspector} decides
 * if a feature is transient by referring to the annotation
 * on the most specific superclass.
 * If no {@code Transient} annotation is present
 * in any superclass the feature is not transient.
